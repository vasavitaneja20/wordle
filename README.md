I have recreated the popular game Wordle (by New York Times). To play this game, here are a few rules you need to keep in mind:
1) The program will fetch a random 5-letter word. You have a total of 6 tries to guess the word.
2) For each guess, you received a colour-coded version of your input. For each letter of your input, you need to check the colour coding.
3) If the colour of your letter is green, your letter is correct and at the right position.
4) If the colour of your letter is yellow, your letter does exist in the actual word, but at another position.
5) If the colour of your letter is white/grey, your letter does not exist in the word.
6) If you guess the word within 6 tries, you win! Else, you lose

Some of the key elements of this project are:
1) Loops and conditional statements for matching of input.
2) Colour-coding to make it easier for the user to check for match.
3) API used to fetch random words.

Note: You need to install cURL on your windows to run this code.

Have fun playing!
